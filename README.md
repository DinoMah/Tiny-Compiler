Extended Tiny Compiler

Extended Tiny Compiler from Kenneth C. Louden re-written in Ruby (2.7.1).

Has an adhoc virtual machine that can be easily extended for more functionalities.

Required gems to run the project:
  - FXRuby (1.6.42)
  - rubytree (1.0.0)
You can find the gems on RubyGems.org and install them (including posible dependencies indicated in the documentation page for each gem)
  
Running the project:
  - Locate 'ide.rb' file for running the little ide and execute in the command line 'ruby ide.rb'
  
Examples can be found in the testing folder (Open sintacticamente_correcto.txt file to run the compiler, press the play button. If you make changes just click the save button and run).
 Data is stored in plain .txt files so you can easily see whats happening in the compilation process
